"""Every coin's value the ord walk has seen, kept on disk beside the index (2026-10-25: "Remember + parallel
asks").

The walk needs the value of each coin a transaction spends ahead of an inscribed one (the koinu an inscription sits on
is counted across the inputs). It kept the last 500,000 values in memory, only those of 1 coin or less, and lost them
all at every start, so it asked a Core again for transactions it had walked long before -- each a random read on the
lender's disk (2026-10-25: Strawberry, borrowing Dogecoin from .25's hard disk, 40-250 ms a transaction, up to ~700 a
2023 block, 0.02 blocks a second; more than 99% of them coins made after the index's first block). Kept here, a coin
the walk has seen is never asked again: only coins older than the index's first block are.

A value is the transaction's own: the key is its id and output number, and nothing goes in that was not read from
bytes that hash to that id (rawchain.read_tx / read_block, ord_notes.decode). So the file is never wrong, only short --
a reorg, a crash, a value let go of early just mean asking a Core again. Spent coins are let go of; a coin spent before
the backfill brought it in stays (harmless: its value is still its value).

`from` is the first block the walk filed here; the blocks before it (walked before this file existed) are brought in
once by the lanes, a chunk at a time (DoginalIndex._values_wanted), and each chunk brought in is marked done.
