"""A Meshtastic radio as a frame pipe: USB serial, TCP or Bluetooth.

Frames travel as PRIVATE_APP direct messages; stock firmware encrypts those
end to end (PKC) and every Meshtastic node relays them.

Frames go with no radio ack (2026-10-26): each send waited for the other
radio's ack, up to 75 s, so one lost ack held a whole answer for a minute; and
the T-Deck's acks collided with the next parts (MAX_RETRANSMIT, 2026-10-23).
Now the parts of an answer go one after another, a short gap apart, and the
protocol recovers what is lost: the T-Deck asks again for an answer that does
not come and sends RESEND for the parts of one that stopped. Received
frames are handled on a worker thread, never the radio library's reader
thread, so a handler that sends can wait for acks the reader delivers.
