"""T-Decks over WiFi (2026-10-26: "You should be able to connect to Wi-Fi and stay connected to Wi-Fi and while
you're connected to Wi-Fi have sign in and be done through Wi-Fi" ... "When connected to Wi-Fi, all messages and
transactions should be sent through Wi-Fi").

A T-Deck on WiFi speaks the very frames it sends over LoRa (arcade-lora's PROTOCOL.md), posted here over HTTPS instead
of carried by a radio. They go to a gateway this arcade runs for WiFi T-Decks -- the same arcade/lora Gateway as the
radio one, with no radio: sign-in, balances, payments and letters all work unchanged.

POST /r/tdeck/link, body = token[16] + n x (u16 length + frame). The token is the T-Deck's own random secret, kept on
its flash; it names the T-Deck's place here (a node number made from it, so its letters cursor survives), and nobody
without it can read that place's answers. The account itself is proven the usual way, by HELLO/LOGIN with its key.
The answer is n x (u16 length + frame): the replies to what was posted, and whatever waited for it (letters). A post
with no frames waits up to POLL_WAIT seconds for something to come, so letters reach the T-Deck within seconds.
