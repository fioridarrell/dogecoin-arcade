# The .mesh web, and a site on any name

A small web for the LoRa mesh, made the way the web was in 1990: plain text, headings, lists and links, nothing else.
Every page belongs to a `.mesh` name, and the wallet holding the name decides what its page says. A DogecoinArcade
T-Deck reads pages in the **Browser** app (from its App Store), over WiFi or by radio.

The same **Browser** on the PWA and the website (`/browser`) opens the site of **any** name: `.mesh`, `.pepe`, `.doge`
and every other ending, on every chain the arcade reads. Those sites are not limited the way `.mesh` ones are; see
[Sites on any name](#sites-on-any-name).

## A name

A `.mesh` name is an ordinary name inscription on **Pepecoin mainnet**:

```
{"p":"dns","op":"reg","name":"yours.mesh"}
```

Claim one from **Creator → Names**. The first claim of a name owns it, and whoever holds that inscription holds the
name: send it to someone and the name goes with it.

## A page

A page is another inscription on Pepecoin mainnet, made to the address that holds the name:

```
{"p":"mesh","name":"yours.mesh","pages":{"/":"# Welcome\n...","/about":"..."}}
```

- `pages` holds the whole site: `/` is the front page; other paths are short words (`/about`, `/notes/today`) of
  lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, up to 24 of them.
- The whole inscription is at most **3,000 bytes**, so every page loads over LoRa too.
- **Which page counts:** the newest page inscribed to the address that holds the name *now*. Publish again to change
  your site. If the name is sold, your pages stop counting, and the new holder's pages count instead.

**Creator → Names → Publish a page** writes this for you, with a preview at the T-Deck's size.

## MeshText

Each page is plain text, one line at a time:

| Line | Shows as |
|---|---|
| `# Title` | a big heading (the first one is the page's title) |
| `## Section`, `### Small` | smaller headings |
| `* item` | a list item |
| `> words` | a quote |
| `=> other.mesh/path Label` | a link to another site; `=> /path Label` is a page of this site |
| `![What it shows](inscription id)` | a picture: any image inscription |
| ```` ``` ```` | starts or ends preformatted text, kept exactly (ASCII art) |
| anything else | a paragraph line |

There are no colours, fonts or scripts. The T-Deck draws every page in its own font on a 320 × 240 screen.
Short lines read best.

## Pictures

A picture is its own inscription, so it does not count toward the 3,000 bytes. Put any image inscription on a page:

```
![Sunset over the lake](d737d773afcafa0b445def80f4dc43fc596cf185eac93941702675df384ac260i0)
```

A browser shows the inscription itself. A T-Deck gets it the way the web drew pictures in 1994, **from the top down**:
the arcade makes it at most 300 × 200 in 16 colours, in bands of rows that each fill about one LoRa part, so every part
that arrives draws a few more rows. At most about 8 KB, about a minute by radio and instant over WiFi. A T-Deck keeps
the last 16 pictures it read and never asks for those again. Small, flat pictures (pixel art, 16 colours or fewer)
come through exactly and in a few hundred bytes.

## Reading pages

- **On a T-Deck:** the Browser asks a gateway, over WiFi or LoRa. A page it has already read comes from its own
  memory unless the site changed. Any site can be set as its homepage.
- **In a browser:** `https://app.dogecoinarcade.com/meshweb/yours.mesh` shows a page at the T-Deck's size.
  `/meshweb` lists every site.
- **For programs:** `GET /r/mesh` is the directory (every name with a page, newest first);
  `GET /r/mesh/yours.mesh/about` is one page as JSON: `body` (its MeshText), `title`, `paths`, `page` (the
  inscription), `holder`, `pictures`. Add `?have=<page>` and an unchanged site answers `{"unchanged": true}` without
  its body. `GET /r/mesh/picture/<inscription id>` is a picture as a T-Deck draws it (the format is in
  `arcade/mesh_picture.py`).

## Sites on any name

Any p:dns name can have a site, made the same way: a `{"p":"mesh","name":"yours.pepe","pages":{...}}` inscription to
the address holding the name, on the chain the name lives on. The newest one by the holder counts. **Creator → Names →
Publish a site** writes it for you. Read in the Browser on the PWA and the website, so not limited for LoRa:

- no 3,000-byte cap: the record can be up to 64 KB, and its pages can be inscriptions of their own of any size;
- a page can be MeshText (pictures and all), **HTML** (`{"html": "<!doctype html>..."}`), or **another inscription**
  (`{"id": "<inscription id>"}`: a page, a picture, a game);
- HTML runs sandboxed, the way every inscription does: it reaches nothing of the arcade's and sends no cookies. Use
  relative links between its pages (`about`, not `/about`).

For programs: `GET /r/sites` lists every site on every chain, each with its `chain`; `GET /r/site/yours.pepe/about`
is one page (`kind`: `text` with `body`, or `html` / `id` with a `url` to show it in a frame); `?chain=` picks the
chain when a name has a site on more than one (it answers 300 with the `choices` otherwise). A page of a site on its
own is `/site/<chain>/yours.pepe/about`.
